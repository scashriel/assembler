# assembler
A program that translates from assembly to machine language
The program receives one or more assembler files and converts each file into machine language using by making two passes over
the file. If there are errors in the assembler file, an error log is created to find all the relevant errors. Otherwise, an
object file is created, as well as extern and entry files, if relevant.
